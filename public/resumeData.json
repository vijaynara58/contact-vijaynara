I have always struggled to answer when asked for what qualities I have. But one day, I realized that I am observing(strong), adjustable to the environment so flexible, good at communication(have studied English literature a lot), thoughtless when intended and deep thinker and focused when required, the nature attracts me(cannot ignore any movement around me), loves everyone in the world(have done things for strangers happiness), Quick thinker(very quick actually), good performer at sports(highly motivated), loves science(logic is something that my thoughts crave for), creative also(test me). I also write blogs related to anything that can be given a thought. I acknowledge that all information here is verified by me carefully.",
